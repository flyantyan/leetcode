		 * any number is always less than that number), so we let the currentsum
		 * to be 0 (simply drop before result) under this condition and
		 * recalculate the summation again from 0 and current position.
		 * Otherwise, currentsum is the summation of previous currentsum and
		 * number of current position Then we renew the maximum summation
